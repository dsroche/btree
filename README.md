# btree
B-tree implementation in Java with pre-emptive splitting

**Requirements**: JUnit 4 (package `junit4` in Debian/Ubuntu).

The B-Tree class implementation is in `BTree.java`. Unit tests are in
`BTreeTest.java`. Run `make check` to compile and run the tests.

Note, you may need to modify the first lines of the `Makefile` if your
JUnit4 jar is in a different location.
